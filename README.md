11. Use line breaks after open and before close array brackets if an array has multiple lines.

12. Do not unnecessarily escape characters in strings.

13. Always put default parameters last.

14. Multiline imports should be indented just like multiline array and object literals.

15. Assign variables where you need them, but place them in a reasonable place.

17. If using multi-line blocks with if and else put else on the same line.
